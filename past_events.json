Pizzapalooza 2023 hosted four live DJs, from campus and beyond!\nThe first was dotdom, who opened the day with a hardcore mix of techno, trance, and beyond.\nThe second was xxhardbit3s, who knocked the roof off the place (if there had been a roof) with a truly murderous mix of jersey club and a deep dive through the Internet.\nThe third DJ up was DJ Re:Code, a rising figure in the HyperPop Community, who delivered an explosive set filled with deconstructed club and future pop bangers.\nUp fourth (and last) was curro!, finishing off the day (now afternoon) with her brand of psychedelic 2000s nostalgia pop and throwback remixes.
